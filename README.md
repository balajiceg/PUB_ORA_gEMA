# Quantifying ORA Visits Using GPS Traces

This project focuses on measuring time spent in outdoor recreational areas (ORAs) by combining GPS trace data with spatial boundaries of ORAs derived from OpenStreetMap, Esri Parks, and PAD-US datasets.

## Features
- Curates ORA boundary datasets  
- Applies staypoint clustering methods to identify meaningful visits  
- Performs spatiotemporal processing of GPS traces to extract ORA visits and estimate their duration  

### Instructions
- Run the scripts in the order provided within the project directories to reproduce the workflow.
